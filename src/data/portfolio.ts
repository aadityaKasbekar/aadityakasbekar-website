      description: "For a global retail client, I re-architected a legacy inventory system to resolve critical scalability bottlenecks during peak sales events. I refactored backend logic using Java Spring Boot and optimized MySQL queries, implementing a distributed Redis caching layer that reduced query response times by 40% to meet strict SLAs. To accelerate engineering velocity, I designed an automated CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins and Docker that cut build and release times by 50%, while integrating CloudWatch for real-time observability. By streamlining ReactJS front-end components and resolving complex concurrency issues, I delivered a robust, high-performance platform capable of handling massive data loads without interruption.",
