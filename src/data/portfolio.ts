      description: "For an SAT tutoring platform, I Re-Architected a legacy FastAPI & MySQL question generator into an event driven hybrid architecture (microservices plus serverless functions) to scale for high concurrency and higher request throughput. I designed a multi store data layer using AWS RDS (MySQL) for user data, MongoDB for question/performance documents, Pinecone for embeddings, and S3 for diagram/image assets, enabling per student history tracking and content reuse controls. I built a RAG based semantic generation pipeline using OpenAI & Pinecone, standardizing outputs with prompt engineering and JSON schema style constraints to enforce deterministic MCQ structures and reduce repetition. To improve correctness, I added cross model verification by routing generations to Gemini for solving and answer checking, filtering low quality outputs. I productionized deployments on AWS with an ALB, blue/green releases, AMIs, and CloudWatch observability, and implemented Terraform plus GitHub Actions with Docker CI/CD with automated tests and SQS based async workflows for reporting and email delivery.",
